            Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms
            of Service") carefully before using the
            https://www.proconduck.com website (the "Service")
            operated by ProConDuck ("us", "we", or "our").

            Your access to and use of the Service is
            conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance
            with these Terms. These Terms apply to all
            visitors, users and others who access or use the
            Service.

            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be
            bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part
            of the terms then you may not access the
            Service.</p>
        <h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web
            sites or services that are not owned or controlled
            by ProConDuck.

            ProConDuck has no control over, and assumes no
            responsibility for, the content, privacy policies,
            or practices of any third party web sites or
            services. You further acknowledge and agree that
            ProConDuck shall not be responsible or liable,
            directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss
            caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection
            with use of or reliance on any such content, goods
            or services available on or through any such web
            sites or services.

            We strongly advise you to read the terms and
            conditions and privacy policies of any third-party
            web sites or services that you visit.</p>
        <h3>Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in
            accordance with the laws of New York, United
            States, without regard to its conflict of law
            provisions.

            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of
            these Terms will not be considered a waiver of
            those rights. If any provision of these Terms is
            held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in
            effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
            between us regarding our Service, and supersede and
            replace any prior agreements we might have between
            us regarding the Service.</p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to
            modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a
            revision is material we will try to provide at
            least 15 days notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be
            determined at our sole discretion.

            By continuing to access or use our Service after
            those revisions become effective, you agree to be
            bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to
            the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
